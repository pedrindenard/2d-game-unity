# 2D Game created using Unity IDEA and C#

Game developed on a 2D platform, using Unity's IDEA for graphic development and C# for code manipulation through IDEA Visual Studio Code.

This game is an "MMO", where the main character will have an inventory and health bar, in addition to a weapon for combat.

## Maps
The game consists of 3 maps.
* Black Forest
* Caves
* Boss

All maps fit together, giving continuity to the game. For each map, collectibles and weapons to pick up, as well as enemies and final boss, will be available.

The maps were developed through Unity's IDEA using Sprites.

## Characters
The main character availability features standard physics. He has the ability to jump, walk, crouch, attack, change direction on the map, take damage and die. In addition, it contains a life bar that can accumulate a greater amount of life throughout the game, making it more difficult for the character to die.

## Inventory
The game has an inventory that allows the player to view, select, equip, upgrade, and drop items. In this inventory, in addition to the previously mentioned weapons, it is possible to find other items and resources relevant to the game.

By selecting an item from the inventory, the player can equip it for immediate use by the character. Upgrading items in the inventory allows you to improve their characteristics, the maximum possible upgrades in a weapon are five, with the cost of two hundred coins for each upgrade. For each upgrade, a characteristic is improved, such as weapon damage or arrow speed. Also, it is possible to discard an item from the inventory, permanently removing it from the character's possession.

## Weapons
The available weapons are divided into three types: Axe, Bow (arrow) and Staff (magic). Each weapon type has three tiers: normal, advanced, and elite. Each weapon level increases both the minimum and maximum damage it deals.

The Ax is a type of weapon that does not have variations in types or attributes other than the increase in damage provided by different levels. The three levels of axes, normal, advanced and elite, gradually increase the damage the ax can do.

The Bow and arrow, in turn, have different types of arrows. They are: normal, advanced and elite. Each type of arrow increases not only maximum and minimum damage, but also the speed of arrows fired from the bow.

Finally, we have the Staff of Magic. Like the bow and arrow, the magic staff also has three types: normal, advanced and elite. Each type of staff increases maximum and minimum damage from magic attacks.

## Enemies and bosses
Enemies in the game have distinct characteristics and interesting interactions with the player. Each enemy will have a specific weakness and resistance, as well as an amount of damage it deals when hitting the player or an amount of damage received from the player equivalent to the weapon and or effect it uses on the weapon. Also, when the player manages to defeat an enemy, he will receive resources or life, allowing him to continue his journey and make improvements and upgrades.

It is also interesting to note that the enemies have personalities similar to the player's, but with behaviors limited to breathing animations, walking, changing direction and jumping. These animations help bring enemies to life and make them more realistic in their behavior.

To emphasize a greater challenge when facing an enemy, artificial intelligence has been added so that enemies can detect and identify the player, initiating an active pursuit.

The boss is designed around programmed routines to add variety and unpredictability to your actions. Each routine has a percentage chance of being performed, ensuring that the moves are not always the same.
